        "editor_main": "Welcome to CyberScript Editor:\\n\\n\\nHere You can use CyberScript to create Your own content like Quests, Events, Places, Dialog...\\n\\n\\nFirst, some basics: \\n\\n\\nAlmost every Element that You will see, will comply with CyberScript's Script System.\\n\\nA Script contains basic Properties like a Tag (Unique Identifier), a Name.\\n\\nIt will also have a Trigger Element that has several Properties.\\n\\nA Trigger is a Script Object that will, as the name implies, Is trigger to an Event, by the events Tag. \\n\\nBasically, when the Trigger's Condition is fullfilled, CyberScript's Script System Engine (SSE) will know that This event can play.\\n\\nUsually, Triggers have: \\n- A Name\\n- Some Conditional Properties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExample: \\n\\n{\\n'name':'3Dposition',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n}\\n\\n\\nIn This Example, the Trigger, '3Dposition', will check that Player's position is in a range of 50 meters from X:500, Y:500, Z:500.\\nIf yes, the Trigger will check SEE Engine, and will return True.\\nIf no, The Trigger wil check the Engine, and will return False.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, an Element can have several Trigger Conditions. We wrap it into a Property, Labeled 'Requirement'.\\n\\n A 'Requirement' is an Order of how the Triggers need to be fullfilled.\\n\\nFor Example\\n\\nlet's say We have a Quest that has 3 Triggers:\\n\\n'trigger':\\n\\n'trigger01': {\\n'name':'3Dposition',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n},\\n'trigger02':{\\n'name':'in_car',\\n'x': 500,\\n'y': 500,\\n'z': 500,\\n'range':50\\n},\\n'trigger03':{\\n'name':'time',\\n'min': 1800,\\n'max': 2300\\n}\\n\\n\\ntrigger01 will be fullfilled when the Player is in range of 50 Meters for the position: XYZ: 500,500,500.\\n\\ntrigger02 will be fullfilled when the Play is in a car.\\n\\ntrigger03 will be fullfilled when the game's time is between 18:00 (6pm) and 23:00 (11pm).\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's say we want our Quest to Run when: \\n\\ntrigger01 is fullfilled\\n\\nOR\\n\\ntrigger02 AND trigger03 is fullfilled\\n\\n\\nThese Conditions are what we call a requirement.\\n\\nIn json, it's formated like:\\n\\n'requirement':\\n[\\n ['trigger01'],\\n ['trigger02','trigger03']\\n \\n\\n]\\n\\n\\nYou can see it have 2 'groups': \\none contains trigger01\\nseconds contains trigger02 AND trigger03\\n\\n\\nWe can Translate it by:\\nrun my Quest when Group 1 is fullfilled (trigger01) OR group2 is fullfilled (trigger02 AND trigger03).\\n\\nEach group is a OR\\nEach Element in a Group is a AND\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, last Element that our Object has is an Action List.\\n\\nWhich is, by it's name, a List of Actions that the Script will run, in order, when Requirements are fullfilled.\\n\\nLet's look at an Example: \\n\\n'Actions':\\n[\\n\\n  {\\n'name':'notify',\\n'value':'Hello from CyberScript's Team:) '\\n},\\n{\\n'name':'wait_second',\\n'value':5\\n},\\n{\\n'name':'notify',\\n'value':'Judy is Love, Judy is Life '\\n}\\n\\n]\\n\\nIn This example: \\na notification message will show, with text: Hello from CyberScript's Team:)\\n\\nThen the script will wait 5 seconds\\n\\n A notification message will show, with text: Judy is Love, Judy is Life\\n\\n\\nAs You can see, Actions have a very similar syntax like Triggers. they both have a name, and some parameters that depend on the nature of the Action.\\n\\n\\nNow let's Describe every Element of the Editor:\\n\\n\\n\\nQuest: You can  make a Custom Quest with one, or several Objectives. It can  be chained, or can  be Active in parallels of other Objectives.\\n\\n\\n\\nDialog: You can  make a Custom Dialog with several Choices that will Launch Actions, specified by You, in Your Script.\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoneDialog: You can  make a Custom phone dialog(Text Msg Thread) with several Choices that will Launch Actions. It will show the in-game's 'Messages' Tab.\\n\\n\\n\\nInteract: You can  make a Custom Interact with several Choices that will Launch Actions.\\n\\n\\n\\nEvent: You can make an Event that will Launch in the Game World, with different actions happening Set by You, Example would be A gang Fight.\\n\\n\\n\\nFixer: You can make a fixer who can Trigger some Quests.\\n\\n\\n\\nFaction: You can make a Gang with several Options.\\n\\n\\n\\nRadio: You can make a Custom Radio station that will play Custom Music.\\n\\n\\n\\nLang: You can make Your own lang file to translate Mods/ mod \\n\\n\\n\\nItems: If You are in a custom Place, You can make an exterior/interior, with Decor\\n\\n\\n\\nTheme: You can change CET color style for the mod's hud.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterface: You can make Your own Interface (a Native Popup that will show buttons and text, Made by You)\\n\\n\\n\\nHelp: You can make a Custom Shard that is Tagged as Help, Useful for typing out details about Your mod.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlace: You can define a Location as a Custom Place and setup several Events in it (Basically, Housing, or Own This Place)\\n\\n\\n\\nFunction: a Re-usuable Script/Object that contains a List of Actions, Made by You.\\n\\n\\n\\nNode: a Node is an XYZ Location that has a Tag and several Properties and can be bounded to a Circuit and a Path\\n\\n\\n\\nCircuit: it's an Order of Nodes.\\n\\n\\n\\nPath: it's a path that can be played (for vehicle like metro for example)\\n\\n\\n\\nCustom NPC: You can setup an NPC who will spawn when You reach it's Location, and Range.\\n\\n\\n\\nShard: You can setup a Custom Shard that You can Acces through the Shard Menu\\n\\n\\n\\nmod Builder: Here is the final step to make all of those Script/Objects that You created into a mod!:)\\n",
